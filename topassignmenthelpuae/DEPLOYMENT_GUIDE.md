# Laravel Application Deployment Guide

## Removing "public" from URL

This Laravel application has been configured to work without the "public" directory in the URL. Here are the deployment options:

### Option 1: Using .htaccess (Apache Servers)

The application includes a `.htaccess` file in the root directory that:
- Serves static assets (CSS, JS, images) from the `public/` directory
- Routes all other requests through the root `index.php` file

**Requirements:**
- Apache web server with mod_rewrite enabled
- AllowOverride All in your Apache configuration

### Option 2: Using web.config (IIS Servers)

The application includes a `web.config` file for Windows/IIS servers that:
- Handles URL rewriting similar to .htaccess
- Includes security headers

### Option 3: Virtual Host Configuration (Recommended for Production)

For production servers, configure your virtual host to point directly to the `public` directory:

#### Apache Virtual Host Example:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/laravel/app/public
    
    <Directory /path/to/your/laravel/app/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Nginx Configuration Example:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    root /path/to/your/laravel/app/public;
    
    index index.php;
    
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }
    
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

## File Structure

```
laravel-app/
├── .htaccess          # Apache URL rewriting
├── web.config         # IIS URL rewriting  
├── index.php          # Root entry point
├── public/            # Static assets directory
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   ├── img/
│   └── index.php      # Original Laravel entry point
├── app/
├── resources/
└── ...
```

## How It Works

1. **Static Assets**: CSS, JS, images are served directly from `public/` directory
2. **Laravel Routes**: All other requests are processed by the root `index.php`
3. **URL Structure**: 
   - ✅ `yourdomain.com/` (home page)
   - ✅ `yourdomain.com/about` (about page)
   - ✅ `yourdomain.com/css/style.css` (static assets)
   - ❌ `yourdomain.com/public/` (no longer needed)

## Testing

1. Place your Laravel application in your web server directory
2. Ensure mod_rewrite is enabled (Apache) or URL Rewrite module (IIS)
3. Access your domain without `/public/` in the URL
4. Verify that CSS, JS, and images load correctly

## Security Notes

- The root `index.php` only handles Laravel routing
- Static assets are served directly by the web server
- All Laravel files outside `public/` remain protected
- Security headers are included in web.config for IIS

## Troubleshooting

**CSS/JS not loading?**
- Check that static asset rules in .htaccess/web.config are correct
- Verify file permissions on the public directory

**404 errors on routes?**
- Ensure mod_rewrite (Apache) or URL Rewrite (IIS) is enabled
- Check that .htaccess/web.config files are being read

**Still seeing /public/ in URLs?**
- Clear browser cache
- Check that you're accessing the root domain, not /public/ directly
