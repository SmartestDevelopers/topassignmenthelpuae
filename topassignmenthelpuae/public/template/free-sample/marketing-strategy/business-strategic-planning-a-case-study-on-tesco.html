                    <h2 class="mb-3">Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify">Strategic planning of the business is a crucial tactics for all the corporate firms across the globe to maximise its value and secure future sustainable development through developing proper strategies (Lasserre, 2017). The aim of the study is to evaluate the strategic planning of Tesco and develop an effective planning through which the company can run their operational activities sustainably. Tesco is the largest retailer, established in 1919 and the company is reputed due to its widest supermarket chain across the UK as well as other international markets such as China, India, Malaysia, Ireland, Poland and Hungary. The organisation is efficient in retaining the customers across the global markets and satisfying them through delivering quality products and efficient services according to the needs and preferences of the customers.
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Strategic planning</h2>
<h2 class="mb-3">Provide an assessment of the extent to which Tesco’s mission, vision, objectives, goals, core competencies inform its strategic planning</h2>
<p align="justify">Tesco is a famous retailer across the globe whose profitability and sales volume further provides the company to utilise more opportunities through positive investment and satisfying all the stakeholders of the business (Tesco, 2018a).

The mission statement of the company is ‘We make what matters better, together’ (Tesco, 2018b). The mission statement is also effective to form proper strategic planning so that it is possible to achieve the organisational objective. </p> 
<p align="justify">The vision of the company is ‘to be the most highly valued business by: the customers we serve, the communities in which we operate, our loyal and committed colleagues and of course, our shareholders’. The organisation wants to be the famous business through innovation and creativity so that it can secure sustainable development in near future. In addition to these, the objective of the firm is to inspire all the stakeholders through building trust and loyalty with all the stakeholders engaged with the business. The business is willing to be the champion for their customers by helping them to enjoy better quality of life in an easier way of living. In this regard, Tesco focuses on the quality products and affordable price so that the customers can purchase more units of products at lower price as compared to other competitive firms in the market. This is also an effective strategy for the company to meet the objective of the business and gain high competitive advantage through developing effective strategic planning. The values of Tesco are,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the customers</li>
    <li>Be the first to meet the needs and preferences of the customers</li>
    <li>Act responsibly for the social community</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The above mentioned values also influence the company Tesco to for proper strategic planning through which they can maximise their vision and mission statement (Tesco, 2018c). Understanding the people including the customers, colleagues and community is necessary and in this regard Tesco focuses on listening the perspectives of all the stakeholders so that they can firm appropriate planning to meet the demand of the stakeholders (Tesco, 2017). In this regard, the company also aims at treating the people fairly as per their requirements and in order to maximise trust and loyalty, Tesco concentrates on,</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Work as a team</li>
    <li>Share knowledge and experience</li>

    <li>Trust and respect each other</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">These are efficient to meet the organisational values and Tesco mainly focus on its aims and objectives so that it can run their business activities strategically (Tesco, 2018d). The above mentioned aims, objectives as well as vision and mission are therefore beneficial which influence the company to develop appropriate strategic planning for securing future sustainable development (Tesco, 2016). </p>
<p align="justify">The company also has crucial core competencies which are also advantageous as it provide an opportunity to Tesco to form proper planning for running the business activities strategically. The core competencies are such as,</p>
<ul>
    <li>Making the life of the customers easier to live healthier</li>
    <li>Sourcing great quality and affordable products</li>
    <li>Making positive contribution to the society</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">These are the main strategic planning through which Tesco tries to achieve the vision and mission of the organisation (Tesco, n.d). </p>
<h2 class="mb-3"> Analyse the factors that have to consider when formulating strategic plans</h2>
<p align="justify">The above mentioned vision and mission of Tesco is the main factors that influence the managers to develop an effective strategic planning. In addition to these, the values that the organisation set are the second factor that leads the company towards developing an essential business strategic planning through which it is possible to meet the mission and vision of the company (Tesco, 2014). The environmental concern is the third factor where the company is raising awareness about the positive environmental footprint and this is important in establishing a good strategic planning where the company can achieve environmental sustainability. The fourth factor that is effective in formulating strategies planning is the tag line of Tesco which is ‘’Every little helps’, which influence the company to increase innovation and creativity to serve unique service to the customers that will maximise the values for all the customers (Wearden, 2014). The SMART goals and objectives of the firm are also other factors that are considered to be important to set appropriate strategic planning which further provides an opportunity to Tesco to run their operational activities strategically across the globe. The company is also concerned about the competitive advantage and in this regard it is another crucial factor that also motivates the managers of the company to set effective strategy so that high markets hare can be achieved.

On the other hand, the opportunities are increasing demand for retail items as well as rapid growth in e-commerce. Moreover, the innovative digital media for promotional activities and market expansion are other opportunities through which Tesco can run their business sustainably (Kantar World panel, 2015). There are some threats such as economic recession, rising cost of raw material and high competition which may raise difficulties for Tesco to develop effective strategic planning. As per the above analysis, it can be stated that, the strategic position of the company is strong where the organisation has the capability to maximise their performance to manage all the stakeholders successfully.

Monitoring their behaviour, motivating them and sharing information fairly are the tactics of Tesco to satisfy the stakeholders and retain them for long run.
