                    <h2 class="mb-3">Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify">International marketing is a multinational planning process through which it is possible for the corporate firms to expand their business and promote the organisational products and services successfully in the international markets across the globe (Armstrong et al., 2015). The marketing strategic planning and international trade are helpful for the firms who are trying to expand their business as these provide a scope to the firm to represent the business at the international level. The aim of the study is to analyse the importance of marketing strategic planning as well as identify the issues in developing international marketing strategies. In addition to these, the paper also aims at discussing the factors considered in the marketing strategic planning of the company where it is possible to develop effective marketing mix planning for successful internationalisation of the brands. In the recent era of globalisation, all the multinational corporate firms focus on internationalisation through international trade and developing effective marketing strategy so that they can establish the business across the globe and run the operational activities proficiently. 
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Analysing the motives and strategic decisions necessary for successful international marketing operations</h2>

Through strategic planning, the organisations can develop the planning for international trade where the companies try to set clear mission and vision (Tomczak, Reinecke and Kuss, 2018). Proper goals and objectives of the firm s are helpful to set the target and develop effective planning to achieve the target. After setting effective goals and objectives, the organisations need to develop an effective strategy and execute step by step. Moreover, it is necessary to lead the employees for adopting the changes take place as per the strategic planning of the firm and monitor their performance so that it is possible to achieve the organisational goals and objectives.

                                        <p align="justify">
                                          Strategic planning therefore us important for international trade where for example, the business V2: Value & Variety aims at expanding their business across the globe. It is necessary for the organisation to develop effective strategic planning for expanding their clothing business across the international market. It is useful for the brand to develop effective strategic planning after analysing the market condition, competitive power in the market and the customer’s buying behaviour in the country. Market selection is necessary where the company V2: Value & Variety can analyse the market structure of a particular country for example UK. The consumer’s behaviour regarding clothing as well as purchasing power parity of the consumers is considered in this regard for achieving the strategy of international trade. Strategic planning hereby includes market analysis and suitability of different markets where the firm is able to choose the right market where the purchasing power of the customers is high and people prefer quality and fashionable clothing products. There is also a great role of investment in the achieving the strategy of international trade where the company needs to invest huge amount for executing the plan (McDONALD et al., 2016). 
                                        </p>
                                        <p align="justify">Marketing planning and market entry strategy are also needs to be considered in order to achieve the target of international trade. The company V2: Value & Variety in this regard also need to consider the market entry planning through which they can establish their brand in the UK. Moreover, the marketing mix strategic planning is important in this context to promote the organisational products and attract the customers in the UK. Hereby, the strategic decision is important for the entire organisations even for the company V2: Value & Variety to develop the business and establish the brand suitably where internationalisation of the business can be possible through executing effective strategic planning successfully. Moreover the strategic decision is also beneficial for the companies to make effective planning for expanding the business, invest efficiently and improve the employee’s proficiency so that the operational activities can be handled properly (Wrenn and Mansfield, 2014). In addition to these, strategic planning is advantageous or international trade where the business can make the planning for market entry and target the customers in the market and retain for long term through developing effective marketing mix planning (Pulendran, Speed and Widing, 2015). </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Evaluating the strategic issues involved in the selection, entry and development of international markets</h2>
                                        <p>There are several issues associated with the strategic decision, market selection, market entry strategy and international trade for which the companies face difficulties in expanding their business sustainably. the main issue in international trade is market selection where it is difficult for the firm to understand the customer’s demand in the market, industry growth and the perception of the local people in the international country, without proper analysis and evaluation, it is not possible to understand the market structure as well as internal competition in the market (Tanner and Raymond, 2015). developing the market entry strategy is also another issue where the business faces problems in identifying international business for support, it is quiet problematic during joint venture where the firms cannot rely on the international business during the international trade. Apart from that, supply chain and distribution network is another serious issue, where the firms face difficulties in identifying the suppliers and distributors in the international markets. It is also problematic to improve trust and loyalty among the suppliers and retain them for long run (McCamley and Gilmore, 2018). </p>
                                        <img src="../../img/mp101.png">
                                        <p align="justify">Without loyalty and building proper corporate relationship, it is difficult for the firms to retain efficient suppliers and distributors and develop effective supply chain in the new international place for internationalisation. On the other hand, another issue is lack of investment where the companies may not afford the cost of expanding the business through international trade (Johanson, and Mattsson, 2015). There needs to have high investment for internationalising the business. Additionally, lack of efficient employee is also another serious issue where the companies cannot execute the plan due to lack of proper knowledgeable employees in the international place. Without efficient staff members and managers, it is difficult for the business to expand their operational activities across the globe. cultural differences is also another serious problem in the recent era of globalisation, where market expansion is hard for the firms due to cultural differences, employee’s internal conflicts and resistance to change (West, Ford and Ibrahim, 2015). These further raise misunderstanding among the employees and this in turn affects the organisational performance in an adverse manner.  </p>
                                        <p align="justify">Communication gap is also another problem where the staff members and managers face difficulties in communicating with other stakeholders, customers and other local people. As the communicative patter of the international places are different, it is quiet problematic for the firms to expand their business strategically where some employees cannot interact with the local people due to language differences (Strauss and Frost, 2016). It is also hard for the companies to manage the strategic planning and execute it successfully due to non-cooperation, language gap, cultural differences and other issues related to proficiency of the employees and investment. Additionally, there exist political issues due to government rules and regulations for which the firms face problems in internationalising their business where they cannot get license within time or government support for establishing the business. Political instability is therefore one of the serious issues during internationalisation of the company. </p>
                                         <img src="../../img/mp102.png">
                                        <p align="justify">
                                            In the recent era of globalisation, the companies, government and people are concerned about the environmental issues and in this regard it is also another critical task for the business houses to manage the environmental problems and make the business sustainable. It is expensive for the firms to manage sustainability and their needs proper support from the stakeholders to establish the business by reducing environmental risks (Morschett, Schramm-Klein and Zentes, 2015). There are the major issues when the firms are trying to internationalise their business across the globe. For example, V2: Value & Variety also faces difficulties during internationalisation of the firm and the issues are such as lack of sufficient investment, communication gap, lack of promotional tactics and lack of market entry strategy and poor strategic decision. 
                                        </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Appraising the planning processes and methods involved in the generation of strategic choices for international marketing decisions</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The organisations try to develop effective method for market entry for successful establishment of the business houses in the new international places.

                                         <img src="../../img/mp103.png">
                                        <p align="justify">Direct export is mainly when the firm is selling their products directly in the market where the company needs to develop effective distribution network and straighten their supply chain for distributing their products as per the market needs. It is beneficial for the company to establish the business and attract more customers in the new international market. On the other hand, joint venture is also beneficial and it is an effective strategy for the new entrants to conduct an agreement with another local firm and do the business activities jointly.

On the other hand, partnership business is also another effective tactic to enter into new international market. </p>
                                        <p align="justify">In addition to these, partnership business with other local firm helps the new entrant to acknowledge the local culture, business trend, market condition and social classes in the new international market. Licensing is also advantageous for entering into global market where the company needs to do agreement and purchase the licensee for doing the business sustainably in the market. Through these policies, the companies can expand their business internationally and gain competitive advantage in long run. For example, V2: Value & Variety as a clothing firm also aims at expanding their business through effective marketing strategic planning and international trade. In this regard, the company can try to select direct exporting and strengthen their supply chain and distribution network in the UK. Exporting the quality clothing and managing warehouses as well as retaining efficient suppliers and distributors are helpful strategic planning for the business to expand their operational activities across the UK. Hereby, strategic alliances joint venture and partnership as well as direct exporting planning are effective for the companies for entering into new market for establishing their business and running the operational activities successfully.</p>

                                        <p align="justify">Hereby, the above mentioned strategic decision and planning are helpful for the organisations in expanding their business across the international markets. Without proper strategic planning and implementing the planning successfully, it is not possible for the companies to expand their business and establish the firm in new market.
