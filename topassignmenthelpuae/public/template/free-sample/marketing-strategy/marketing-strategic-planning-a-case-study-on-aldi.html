                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Comparing the marketing mix strategies of Aldi and Tesco (P3, M3)</h2>
                                        <img src="../../img/aldi2.png">
                                        <p align="justify">The marketing mix strategic planning is important for both the companies Tesco and Aldi where Tesco is the competitor of Aldi. The comparison of the marketing strategic planning of the companies is essential in this regard to analyse the existing planning for promote their products in the market (Goworek, McGoldrick and McGoldrick, 2015). The marketing mix strategies of Tesco and Aldi are discussed below,</p>
                                        <p><b>Product</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">Product is one of the main categories of the entire firms through which it is possible for the companies to establish the firm at international level (Hanssens et al., 2014). In this regard, both the firms Tesco and Aldi operate in the retail sectors and the products are almost similar such as clothing, home ware appliances, fresh fruits and beverages, household goods, soft tools, electronic products and health and beauty products. In this regard, both the firms try to deliver quality products to the customers so that it is possible for them to gain high competitive advantage. Tesco in this regard also aims at product diversification for targeting different segment of customers by increasing their product line and for this the company gains high market share as compared to Aldi. Both the companies are concerned about customer service efficiency so that they can maximise the customer’s values successfully. Tesco has wider variations of product as compared to the products offered by Aldi and hence as per the product concerned, Tesco has more opportunities to expand their business successfully through product diversification strategy. </p>
                                        <p><b>Price</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">Price is another factor through which it is possible to target the audiences in different international market (Helm and Gritsch, 2014). In this regard, the discounted stores aim at setting low price for the quality products and services. Discounts and gift vouchers in this regard are also beneficial to target the audiences and influence their purchase intention. Both the organisations, Tesco and Aldi focus on the lower price so that the customers can afford the products. The strategy of setting low price is beneficial for both the firms to target the customers and strengthen their customer’s base for long run. </p>
                                        <p><b>Place</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">
                                            Placing the products is also a necessary factor through which the companies can distribute the products successfully in efficient market (Harrington, Ottenbacher and Fauser, 2017). In this regard, Aldi mainly focuses on the physical stores through which the visibility of the organisational products and availability of the products can be improved where the customers in the local market can access the products successfully. On the other hand, Tesco also focuses on the physical stores in different international markets for distributing their products and improving visibility of the organisational products. In addition to these, Tesco also focuses on e-commerce facilities for placing their products successfully in effective market as per the market demand and customer’s preferences and within effective time. Distribution channel of Tesco is also efficient through which the company tries to satisfy the customers by delivering quality products at right place within proper time. Comparing the numbers of stores, Tesco has huge number of physical stores in different international countries where Aldi is also successful in expanding their business through physical stores but it has lower number of stores as compared to Tesco. Tesco has more number of customers who purchase through online website of the company and as compared to Tesco, Aldi has also online customers but the number of the customers making purchase online is lower.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><b>Promotion</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">Promotion is another important factor for improving brand visibility in the market where promotional activities of both the firms Aldi and Tesco are beneficial for the companies to establish the brand sat effective international markets. Promotional activities such as billboards, social media campaigning, television advertisement, email marketing and personal selling are important for the companies to establish the products successfully (Aras et al., 2017). However, Aldi invest very little amount of money in the promotional activity for which it is quiet difficult for them to strengthen their customer’s base in log run. As compared to Aldi, Tesco invests large amount of money for promoting their brand sat international level (Phan and Vu, 2015). Tesco focuses on improving market communication through interaction with the customers which is beneficial for improving loyalty and trust among the customers and retain them for the quality products and services for long time. Tesco tries to utilise their website as well as promote the products through online social media which is absent in case of the promotional strategy of Aldi where the company Aldi only promotes their products through their website. </p>
                                        <p><b>People</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">Employees are the main stakeholders of all the corporate firms where they contribute efficiently to achieve the organisational goals and objectives (Yu, Ramanathan and Nath, 2014). Both the firms, Tesco and Aldi focus on managing their employees and other staff members who are engaged with the production and distribution of the organisational products and services. Tesco provides effective training and development program to the employees so that they can improve their technical skill and experience for working proficiently. On the other hand, Tesco provides safety and security to the employees as well as give them incentives and performance related pay top retain them for long run. On the other hand, Aldi also provides training to the staff members for improving organisational performance and manage people by satisfying them and maximising their values. As per the staff members, Tesco has more staff members in heir retail stores as compared to the staff members hired in Aldi and thus it is quiet beneficial for the company Tesco to provide quality service to the customers due to efficient staff members in every stores. The staff members in both the stores of Tesco and Aldi are efficient to deal with the customers and they respect the customer’s preferences and help them to find out the best quality products which can meet the satisfaction level of the buyers. </p>
                                        <p><b>Physical evidence:</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">Physical evidence is another factor which needs to be improved by the organisations in order to promote the organisations successfully (Melis et al., 2015). The store outlook in this regard also matters in this regard where Tesco has more effective store outlook where the staff members are cooperative and help the customers to make purchase decision. On the other hand, the company Aldi also focuses on improving their service quality so that it is easy to promote the brand at international level.</p>
                                        <p><b>Process</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">Process is also another important factor that contributes in achieving the organisational goals and objectives and in this regard, the companies Tesco  and Aldi also try to conduct more research and development so that they can establish their brand at international level and promote the products successfully. Tesco develops innovative technology to serve the customers and self service technique in this regard is useful to retain the consumers and improve customer’s loyalty. Aldi on the other hand, also aims at develop customer centric business model to create values for their consumers. Tesco provide quicker service as compared to thy customer’s service facilities in Aldi and both the firms have self service option where the customers can have more options for check out. 
As per the above analysis related to the marketing mix planning of Tesco and Aldi, it can be stated that, Tesco is more efficient in developing their marketing planning as compared to the company Aldi. Aldi needs to develop proper planning for successful promotion of the brand at international level so that they can create values for the customers and expand their business worldwide.

The company also develops Information technology and implement Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for tracking the suppliers and distribute the products directly to the customers. In order to strengthen the distribution network, the company can enter into the contract of joint venture with Amazon and Morrison which will be beneficial for the firm to expand their business across the international nations. Amazon is a good platform for the company where the supply chain and distribution network of Amazon can be utilised for distribution the products of Aldi.</p>
<p><b>Promotional strategy</b></p>
<p align="justify">The company needs to invest more for the promotional activities so that it is possible for the brand Aldi to provide effective information and news related to the products, price and organisation to the customers. The company Aldi needs to promote the products through press release where proper information related to price and quality of the products as well as durability and necessity of the products can be discussed in front of others. This is an effective strategy for promoting the products in the society. Moreover, television advertisement is another tactic through which Aldi can retain the customers in the local market. In the promotional planning, the customer loyalty program is another effective tactics which may provide a scope to Aldi to build strong corporate relationship with the customers across the global retail markets. The company needs to promote the customer loyalty cards and include points over the purchasing frequency of the customers. Higher points of the cards indicate that the customers will get better discount. This scheme is beneficial for Aldi to promote their brand at effective market where the customers will be willing to purchase the products from Aldi.</p>
<p><b>Online marketing strategy:</b></p>
<p align="justify">Online marketing strategic planning is necessary for Aldi in order to improve the position of the brand in the international retail market and gain effective competitive advantage in long run. In this r4egard, social media advertisement is necessary which provides a scope to the company to develop two ways communication with the customers and it further helps to improve the quality of customer service. the key words that may help the organisation Aldi to promote the products are such as ‘Affordable to the customers, ‘Lower price’, ‘Quality products’, ‘maximising customer’s values’ and ‘improving satisfaction of the stakeholders’. The company needs to upload short live videos and pictures in Facebook where it is possible to spread the information about the company across the social communities. The company also needs to focus on Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) o that the customers can access th the products of Aldi. Moreover, the company needs to share news and information with the customers through arranging social media campaign which is beneficial to strengthen their customer’s base and retaining more audiences in the market. additionally, the company must send personalise email to the customers and manage customer’s data so that it is easy share information related to the offers, discounts and quality products of Aldi. The company needs to invest in the online advertisement agency for promoting the products such as advertisement through E-commerce platform, social media, YouTube and Facebook for retaining more customers. On the other hand, the company’s website must be improved and the marketing manager needs to develop search Engine Optimisation (SEO) so that the customer can identify the brand successfully.</p>

<h2 class=mb-3>Conclusion</h2>
<p align="justify">Through the marketing analysis, it can be seen that the company Aldi did not invest adequate amount of money in the promotional activities for which the organisation fails to gain high competitive advantage over Tesco and strengthen the customer’s base. In this regard, the company needs to target the women and housewife aged above 25 years and establish the brand in urban areas. Television advertisement, press release and providing customer’s loyalty cards program are beneficial for the company to promote their products in the new international markets. On the other hand, social media advertisement, campaigning, sending personalise email and improving e-commerce facilities are also beneficial for the company Aldi to achieve success and maximise customer’s value. </p>
