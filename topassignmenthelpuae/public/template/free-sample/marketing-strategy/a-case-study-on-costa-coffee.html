</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Based on your analysis, presenting and justifying your recommendations to Costa Coffee UK to increase their current and potential customers</h2>
<p align="justify">The company Costa Coffee is efficient to satisfy the customers by providing quality products and proficient services as per the market trend and the demand of the customers. In this regard, in order to improve communication and knowledge the organisation needs to focus on gathering customer’s feedback which is an Athletic source of information for collecting the perspectives of the customers. Different customer’s feedbacks are effective to develop new planning for market expansion and product development. The company need to focus on Customer relationship management (CRM) as well as implement Information and Communication technology (ICT) for enhancing communication (Rose et al., 2015). In addition to these, the company needs to provide discount coupons and seasonal offers to the customers for improving engagement with the people. It also needs to develop new product for improving variety of taste and this is effective as it helps to retain more new as well as old customers for their quality products (Feldmann and Hamm, 2015).</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Be able to create strategies to increase personal networking to widen involvement in the decision making process</h2>
<p align="justify">In order to launch the Costa Coffee in effective market, it is possible to engage the stakeholders who play important role in running their operational activities strategically. In this regard, customers are the main stakeholders who are the main investors of the company. Product effectiveness is helpful to influence the purchasing power and intention of the customers. The organisation needs to include customers for successful launching as it provides a scope to retain more long run customers and improve trust and loyalty among them (Solaja, Idowu and James, 2016). Secondly, the employees play key role in managing the business and in this regard, launching new products need efficient employees who can manage the quality of the products and serve the customers in innovative way. Thirdly, the investors are the main stakeholders who invest in the product development strategy where the company can place the brand in innovative way. Fourthly, suppliers are also another main stakeholder group who are responsible for supplying raw coffee beans and other ingredients as well as distribute the final products to the customers as per the market trend and consumer’s demand. Fifth, the government is major part of the company whose cooperation is required in order to run the business successfully in the UK market. The company needs to follow the legal rules and legislations for launching the new products successfully. </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Proposing appropriate communication channels that are cost effective to be used to invite your identified stakeholders</h2>
<p align="justify">Proper communication channel can improve business performance as it provides a scope to the representatives of the business to communicate with the stakeholder and enhance cooperation and performance of all the stakeholders. In this regard, company’s own website is one of the main channels to engage with the stakeholders in a cost effective manner. Simple content and the one click option in the website of the organisation are beneficial where the employees, customers and distributors can cooperate with each other. This is also effective platform for communicating with others and gathers information and knowledge from each other. On the other hand, e-mail is another cost effective way for improving communication where the organisational representatives can send email to the customers for providing authentic information regarding product, price and prefers of the company.

Through social media, the company can [post effective content, photos or videos for launching the product and it is also possible for the organisation to improve two way communications between the organisational representatives and customers properly.</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Based on your identified stakeholders explain stakeholder’s interest and feedback</h2>
<p align="justify">The customers are invited in order to launch the new product of Costa Coffee and the key interest of the customers is to maximise their needs and preferences in long run. In this regard, the company Costa Coffee needs to ensure that the new product of the company is effective to satisfy the customers by delivering quality products and efficient services according to their needs and preferences. Additionally, the employee’s interest is to gain high compensations and benefits from the company so that they will be motivated for working efficiently and meeting the customer’s needs in long run. as per the case study of Costa Coffee, the organisation hereby needs to gather effective feedback from the customers as well as the employees in order to evaluate the performance of the company whether they are efficient in managing the customers and employees who are the main stakeholders of the organisation to un their operational activities successfully. On the other hand, government is looking for the performance of the organisation whether they are efficient in managing legal rules regulations or not (Cascio, 2018). Moreover, the investors are concerned about the rate of return and the suppliers are also evaluating whether the company will provide incentives and performance related pay to them as per their performance. </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Designing all-inclusive strategy for the launch of Costa Coffee UK’s new product to be outstanding and unforgettable</h2>
<p align="justify">It is necessary for the Costa Coffee to launch the products effectively in the UK market so that it is possible to target the customers and retain them for long run. It will be beneficial for the Costa Coffee to launch the products in London Coffee festival or in Christmas as these festivals are useful where the company can attract the audiences in the market. Christmas is the biggest festival in the UK and it will be advantageous for the organisation Costa Coffee to launch the products in Christmas where people are in party mood and they enjoy new product innovation at this festival time. Moreover, the company needs to provide free gifts coupons as it helps the customers to feel grate to receive small free gifts from the company (Coombs, 2014). the lucky draw offers for holiday package and free gifts are useful strategic planning for the Costa Coffee through which they can expand their business and retain more customers for their quality products, this is also effective for improving both way communication and increasing trust and customers loyalty in the market. Moreover, the organisational can launch the new product through social media campaigning which is also increasing in the recent years and it provides a scope to the company to improve engagement with the social communities and provide effective message regarding the products and services that the Costa Coffee offers to their customers. This is also another effeti9ve tactic for the organisation to launch the product.</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Reflection on outcome of product launch and key areas of improvement for future events</h2>
<p align="justify">The strategic planning for the company Costa Coffee in order to launch the products is effective where the organisation can retain more customers in the market and launch the product successfully. In this regard, there is some future improvement plan which further provides a scope to the company to gain competitive advantage (Pearson, 2017). The company must focus on the time and place of launch which is necessary and in this context choosing the place with large crowd is suitable for Costa Coffee to attract more audience during Christmas or London Coffee festival.</p>
<h2 class="mb-3"> Report the current Costa Coffee UK’s communication structure and system </h2>
<p align="justify">Communication is one of the main strategic planning for conducting the organisational activities strategically where all the employees can cooperate with each other successfully. In this regard, the organisation Costa Coffee also focuses on improving internal communication so that all the employees can share their views and understanding with other colleagues and senior management team members. In this regard, the management team in Costa Coffee utilise e-mail, telephones and internal software for communicating with others. These sources are useful for interacting between other departments of Costa Coffee. In addition to these, training and development program in Costa Coffee is useful where the employees can interact with each other and share their ideas. The training program therefore provides a scope to the staff members to communicate with others and gain knowledge and understanding so that the organisational objectives can be achieved further positively. Personal contact and telephonic conversation are also other medium to discuss the job related activities with other colleagues and it further helps to resolve any critical situation in the organisation where the employees can share their problems and cooperate with others for achieving the common goals of the firm. On the other hand, external communication is also necessary where the company Costa Coffee aims at communicating with the suppliers, distributors and the customers.</p>
<p align="justify">Open conversation with the customers through telephones as well as the personal interaction through chatting on the organisational website is also helpful for the company to improve interaction with the customers (Crane and Matten, 2016). Additionally, the organisation aims at gathering feedback from the customers sop that it is possible to evaluate the system of the firm and it further helps the managers to analyse the needs and preferences of the customers and develop effective products and efficient service for them so that it is easy to create values for the customers and henceforth, communication with the customers through feedback mechanism is also beneficial for the firm to enhance the organisational performance as a whole. On the other hand, the suppliers also cooperate with the organisational representatives to interact so that it is possible to conduct the job more proficiently and in this regard the organisation tries to stay connected with the suppliers and distributors through GPS system and the telephonic system where the Costa coffee is successful in improving communication (Quirke, 2017). </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Designing effective methods to improvise the overall communication systems at Costa Coffee UK with the emphasis of recent technology invention with modernisation </h2>
<p align="justify">It is necessary for the organisation Costa Coffee to develop communication system as the existing interactive tactics does not provide any scope to the employees to interact with the senior management team or the leaders of the company. It is useful for the company to implement Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to improve internal as well as external communication. Through ICT, the employees can interact with all departments of the company (McQuail and Windahl, 2015). Moreover, the management team needs to arrange general meeting after appropriate time intervals so that the employees can share their views with the top management team and apart from that, the open discussion must be encouraged so that all of the staff can share openly in front of others. Apart from that, there must be personal easy message system for the employees to send personalise message to the top management team regarding their problems, queries and other issues in the workplace. Apart from that, it is necessary for the company to improve communication with the customers through designing effective consumer’s forum where the customers can give their feedback easily (Kaur, 2016). This is another effective way to interact with the customers. Sending personalise e-mail; to the consumers as well as social media interaction are also beneficial for the company to raise interactions with the people (Stelzner, 2014). These strategic planning is effective for the firms to improve the organisational productivity and performance and through communication, the company can manage their stakeholders and run the business efficiently. </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Improvising the current communication mediums between Costa Coffee UK and the local community</h2>
<p align="justify">Interacting with the overall social communities is beneficial for Costa Coffee to improve engagement with the population and attract more audiences for them. In this regard it is necessary for the organisation to develop effective strategic planning to improve communication with the social communities and in this regard, social media is a good platform for improving both way interactions. Costa Coffee needs to promote the products and services through creating short videos and uploading it on Facebook which is the most popular application that people are using in the recent years. Additionally, posting attractive pictures on Facebook and Instagram are helpful for improving engagement with the social communities (Tuten, and Solomon, 2017) (Refer to appendix 2). The company can share effective information regarding the organisational products, services and prices that they offer to the customers which further provides a scope to the brand to attract more audiences in the societies. Moreover, arranging social media campaigning is another tactic for engaging with the customers in the society and it further helps to attract more audiences where the people can identify the brand and access the products and service of Costa Coffee. </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Creating a personal plan to improve your own communication skills</h2>
<p align="justify">It is necessary for me to improve communication style so that I can share my views and understanding with others in the workplace. In this regard, I try to improve my technical skill to interact with the employees and managers and in this regard I try to utilise ICT so that it is easy to communicate with others. Moreover, it is required to improve English so that I can speak fluently and in this regard I try to communicate in English though there are some mistake and hesitation while interacting with others (Business Essentials, 2013). On the other hand, I aim to improve my writing skill so that I can express my understanding through e-mail to the senior managers. In addition to these, positive attitude and interactive behaviour helps me a lot to communicate with others and improve my performance in future. Apart from that, I try to participate in the general meeting of the company and training sessions that the organisation Costa Coffee arranges and I aim to express any views openly in front of others and do my queries to the management team and this further helps me to improve my communication (Refer to appendix 3). </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Reporting on the current method of data collection, formatting, storage and dissemination at Costa Coffee UK  </h2>
<p align="justify">Collecting effective data and market information is necessary for the company Costa Coffee where it is possible to gather proper information for future market analysis and improvement of the organisational products and services. In this regard, the company collects the data from common discussion forum where the customers and other people communicate with each other and provide their feedback about the organisational products and services. Moreover, the company website of the Costa Coffee is effective to collect data where the customers provide feedback about the purchase and their experience about the organisational products. The company Costa Coffee uses Microsoft dynamics NAV and SQL for managing big data in the company and additionally the employees are well organised for managing the data through storing and monitoring the information (Law, Buhalis and Cobanoglu, 2014) (Refer to appendix 4). </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Conducting appropriate changes to improve on the above identified methods in AC4.1 for Costa Coffee UK </h2>
<p>The company needs to improve their data management and controlling tools and in this regard the company needs to focus on the cloud computing which is better strategic planning to run the operational activities successfully. Moreover, the company needs to hire efficient technical head who can restore the pages if crashes as well as resolve the issue of website hacking. Changing password and managing the website of the company are helpful for the organisation to develop effective data management practice on the firm and run the business strategically (Fu, Tanyatanaboon and Lehto, 2015). </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Implementing users-friendly strategy that can improve access and usage of systems in Costa Coffee UK</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The organisation Costa Coffee needs to develop effective strategy which is user friendly and it provides a scope to the organisation to manage the big data in long run. Target the users and retain them through communicating so that they can spend more time to search authentic information regarding the company (Gutteling, 2015). In addition to these, the company needs to implement authentication system for ensuring that the data and information are relevant and true. This further helps to improve security and manage the customer’s data successfully. Authentication needs to be maintained where the data can be protected by the organizational representatives. Moreover, the company needs to hire technical expertise for cloud computing so that they are efficiently handling the operational activities successfully. In this regard, the organisation Costa Coffee also must provide effective training and development program to the employees so that they can improve their technical skill and knowledge to perform better and improve innovation in the organisation through managing communication and knowledge sharing (Cardon and Marshall, 2015). Recovering the data is also necessary where the employee must concentrate about recovering the data if lost (Ocasio, Laamanen, and Vaara, 2018). Fear of loss is another issue due to crashing and in this regard experts need to handle the organisational activities so that the technical proficiency can be improved and the data can be stopped and managed systematically. 
</p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Potential benefit of improving data systems of Costa Coffee in UK</h2>
<p align="justify">The data management system is beneficial for the company to increase the sales volume of the company where the improvements are effective to manage and control the data. Costa Coffee can investigate and collect data from the external sources and develop own strategic planning for gaining high competitive advantage over other competitive firms (Whitebread, 2013).
