                    <h2 class="mb-3" style="font-size:18pxl">Reviewing and embellishing the strengths of the CBA</h2>
<p align="justify">Commonwealth Bank was established in 22 December 1911 as a Government bank, It has 1,100 + branches, 4,300 + ATMs servicing worldwide motto is ‘’CommBank Can’’. Commonwealth bank is recognised for its well-known reputed bank in the Australian market with a well-established network and a strong customer base, it is one of the reliable brands in Australia. </p>
<p align="justify">There was strong economic growth in Indian banking throughout the 5 years period which came next (Austrade, 2016). India's middle class is expanding, which enhances growth opportunities in banking due to an increase in subsequent disposable incomes (DFAT, 2016). 
</p>
<p align="justify">The report is helpful to discuss the commonwealth bank that expands their business in India and it is important to conduct situational analysis in India so that it is possible to understand the environment in the international market and recommend some suitable suggestions for market entry strategy, positioning the business in the international market and developing marketing mix strategy. </p>
<h2 class="mb-3">Situational Analysis</h2>
<h2>Political/Legal</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">
                                          India is a democracy where there are significant changes in the political environment in the recent years after the election of PM Modi of the BJP (DFAT, 2016). leadership change has crucial impacts in India where the PM focuses more on agriculture and small business as well as he is concerned about the investment on the employment in the country (DFAT, 2016).  
                                        </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Economic</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">While analysing the macro environment factors in India, it is necessary to evaluate the economic growth where there is significant growth in the industries in India and potential growth rate and social development influences the foreign investors to invest more in the country for establishing the business in future (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). For example, there is high growth in e-commerce sector in India which further enhances the development of other industries such as banking, commerce as well as fashion industries (Hubbard, Rice & Galvin, 2015). As there is high growth and it can be expected that in future, there will be more growth and development, the Australian companies can expand their business in India for utilising the economic growth in India for successful business establishment. </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Definition of the Market</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The Commonwealth Bank operates in the banking industry where the customers are loyal and open minded for future investment in the bank. the market in India is suitable for the Commonwealth Bank where it is possible for the bank to expand their business in India and establish their business in the market for retaining the customers in the country and serve better banking and financial services to the customers by improving the organisational resources and capabilities (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014).</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Market Size and Outlook</h2>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>As per the information published by the IMF globally the market size in the finance sector is over $77.6 trillion.</li>
                                            <li>There is more than 5.5% growth rate year on year in the Asian countries (IMF 2017).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Market Characteristics</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The middle-class families are growing rapidly in India and this is the reason of increasing urban lifestyle where the people are more interested in investment and in this regard, the Commonwealth Bank targets the market mainly the middle-class families for huge investment for insurance and finance (DFA 2016). There is lack of trust in the local financial institutions in India and the people know that there is high debt which influence them to invest more for future. The investment planning of the Commonwealth Bank in this regard are efficient to target the customers in India and improve investment. </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Target Market </h2>
                                        <p align="justify">It has been projected that, on the first few months, there will be loss as the owner needs to invest more to start up the business. After proper investment, the owner cannot maximise its profitability as at the first pace of the business it is quiet difficult for the owner to retain more customers. After 10th month, it can be predicted that there will be profit volume for the business due to high customer retention. This phase is important for building brand image and customers loyalty in the market where the owner aims at deliver high quality service to the customers at affordable price. </p>
                                        <p><b>Australian Competition</b></p>
                                        <p align="justify">The Indian banking sector is growing rapidly, and it can be seen that, there is huge investment in India in the past few years and it is increasing. In 2016, there was $1476 billion investment and in 2017, it was $1603 billion. In 2018, there is approximately $1715 billion investment in the Indian banking sector and it can be expected that the amount of investment is increasing rapidly in near future (IBISWorld, 2016). There are high competitions in the banking market in the USA due to huge numbers of competitors entering the market, targeting niche areas and driving local competition.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">There is strong presence of independent business in the country and it further provides an opportunity to the Commonwealth Bank to establish their business in India and strengthen customer’s base further by providing efficient service and good financial investment planning. </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">International Competition</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">There is high competition in the international banking and finance market due to high presence of efficient banking institutions who are able to serve the customers with better investments planning and efficient services as per the client’s requirements. As India is growing rapidly in the recent years and banking and investment sector shows high growth, it will be effective for the Commonwealth Bank to establish their business in the country for expanding their brands across the international markets.</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Competition from Substitute Products or Services</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The competition for substitute products in the banking and finance market is also moderate as there are many investment planning through which the people in India can invest for securing their future and gaining higher return on investment. It is hereby essential for the Commonwealth Bank to establish the business through developing effective investment planning that would further attract the customers in India. </p>
                                        <h2>Organisational Analysis</h2>

                                        <h2 class="mb-3">SWOT Analysis</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">SWOT analysis is useful in this context to understand the internal environment of the Commonwealth Bank which further helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the bank as well as identify the market opportunities and threats in the Indian banking and finance market.</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Implications of SWOT Analysis</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The SWOT analysis is beneficial to understand the internal environment of the bank and from the above-mentioned SWOT analysis, it can be stated that, there are positive factors that influence the Commonwealth Bank to enter in the Indian market for successful establishment of the bank. Growing support from the Indian Government is also beneficial for the bank to expand their branches across India. Moreover, the social development of the country as well as economic growth ae helpful for the Commonwealth Bank to increase their reputation and develop effective strategy of word-of-mouth through the tourists and social networks which will be a major opportunity to establish the business strategically (Ashraf, Narongsak, & Auh, 2014). Well regulated banking market industry as well as growth in Asian banking and finance industry are also the opportunity which influences the Commonwealth Bank to flourish in the Indian market by reducing the threats of political instability, uncertainty and high competition. High reputation of the commonwealth bank, strong infrastructure and efficient services such as Insurance, Consumer, Banking, Corporate Banking, Global Wealth Management, Private Equity, Mortgages and Credit Cards are the success factors for the bank to establish their business successfully (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014).</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Objectives</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The objectives of the Commonwealth Bank and the mission statement can be achieved within 12 months through applying own strengths of the bank and utilising the market opportunities in the Indian banking sector which is the fastest growing industry. </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Mission</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Commonwealth Bank focuses on quality service which is for everyone and the mission of the bank is to deliver quality and efficient service to all the clients of their business.</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Business objectives</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The key objectives for Commonwealth Bank to achieve in the new market of India are:</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Successful market entry </h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Online advertising search, display, social and delivering 3 blog posts per week to business communities.</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Recommended Strategy</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The Commonwealth Bank is efficient to develop effective strategic planning for successful market entry in the Indian banking market. The main strategy of the bank is focus strategy where the organisation focuses on the niche market mainly the middle class people where it is possible to target them and retain them for long run investment. The bank focuses on unique products and services in the banking and finance industry which helps the organisation to target the people in India and offers the best possible banking products and services to them (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014).</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Market Entry Strategy</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">In order to access new market like India, the Commonwealth Bank needs to focus on effective market entry strategy so that it is easy to enter into the new international market like India which has high growth rate in the banking and finance sector (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). The selection of the right entry mode is difficult in international marketing and it is necessary for the bank to develop effective planning for successful entry (Baena, 2012).  Commonwealth Bank needs to utilise their resources and capabilities for successful entry while developing the planning by considering increased susceptibility to external forces and management structure (Laufs & Schwens, 2014). The following discusses potential and preferred market entry options for Commonwealth Bank.</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Option 1 - Entering a Joint Venture</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Joint venture is one of the effective strategies for successful market entry where it is possible for the Commonwealth Bank to establish joint venture with a local financial institution to enter into the Indian banking market. The benefits of such strategy are that the Commonwealth Bank needs less capital and resource commitment in this context where the bank also can utilise the access of the market and customers of the local institutions. The market share and the ability to leverage local expertise and contacts will likely increase through joint venture (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). Strong relationship with the business head and cooperation are also other advantages of such joint venture through which the Commonwealth Bank can expand their business in the Indian banking sector. </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Option 2 - Franchising</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Franchising is also another effective strategic planning for successful expansion of the business where the businesses can expand their branches in a cost effective manner. There is lower capital requirements and lower risk if the business expands their branches through franchising and the Commonwealth Bank is a reputed firm which can focus on this tactic of franchising to enter into the Indian banking and finance industry. </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning Strategies</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Segmentation, targeting and positioning strategic planning are helpful for the companies for successful establishment of the brand and it also enhances the performance of the companies in the new international markets (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). The Commonwealth Bank may successfully conduct segmentation by segmenting the new market, determining the right segments to target and developing the best way to position their offering to those chosen targets (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014).</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Segmentation</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Within the broader market of India, there are various criteria that Commonwealth Bank could use in its segmentation approach that includes demographic, behavioural. lifestyle, ethnicity-based and linguistic bases (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). The main aim of segmenting the market is to categorise the potential customers in India with their comparable needs and buying behaviour into segments. The bank mainly considers the segment who are middle class and prefer quality products and services as the bank has the capability to deliver high quality product to the customers according to their needs and preferences.</p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Targeting</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">By reviewing the market segmentation above and determining the Commonwealth Bank’s position as a niche specialist in the market, it is now essential to identify and choose those segments which are beneficial for the bank in near future. The business of commonwealth bank has effective resources and capabilities to deliver best services to these segments and gain competitive advantage (Laufs & Schwens, 2014). </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Positioning </h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The Commonwealth Bank needs to focus on positing the company in the Indian banking industry through developing effective marketing mix strategic planning so that the company can acknowledge the taste and preferences of the customers and serve them in a better and efficient way. </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Segment 1- Unique, optimal quality and value</li>
                                            <li>Segment 2 - Exclusive, unsurpassed quality and experiences</li>
                                            <li>Segment 3 - Accessible, quality service for any location</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Marketing Mix Strategy</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The marketing mix strategic planning is important for the institutions to enter into a new international market and make successful positioning in the country (Kotler & Keller, 2012). For targeting the right customers and promoting the brand in the market, the strategies of marketing mix are unbeneficial as it provides an opportunity to the company to establish the brand successfully and the marketing mix strategies includes product, price, promotion, place, people, process and physical evidence.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">As Commonwealth Bank provides efficient services that are established, the business will take service-based approach to develop the right marketing mix program for delivering their existing products and services to the identified target segments (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). </p>
                                        <h2 class="mb-3">Services and Products </h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Products and services of the company should be unique during international expansion of the organisation so that it is possible to target the customers and retain them for long run. In this regard, the Commonwealth Bank needs to design their financial products that would match the needs and preferences of the customers. Moreover, the bank needs to deliver high quality service to manage the customer’s queries through providing 24*7 services by utilising latest updated technology. </p>
                                        <h2>Price</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">
                                            Price is also another important factor under the marketing mix strategic planning where the bank can attract the customers in the Indian market (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014). Firstly, price needs to be set at similar or less than perceived value which will help the bank to retain more customers in India (Fletcher & Craw ford, 2014).
                                        </p>
                                        <h2>Place</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">Expansion of suppliers across the country as well as strengthen distribution channel in the country are important for the bank so that it can serve the customers in a better way (Fletcher & Crawford, 2014).</p>
                                        <h2>People</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The 'people' is a significant factor in the marketing mix because it is difficult to serve the best quality service to the customers without efficient manpower (Kushwaha & Agrawal, 2015). In this regard, the bank needs to provide proper training to the staff members for performance management as well as encourage them for performing better through motivation, providing rewards ad incentives and flexible working culture in the workplace.</p>
                                        <h2>Physical Evidence and Process</h2>
                                        <p align="justify">The tangible part of the services, physical evidence is also important for successful expansion of the company that includes the facilities, equipment and Information and communication technology (Ivy, 2008). The Commonwealth Bank needs to increase the internal resources, human resources and implement Information and Communication Technology for delivering efficient services to the customers.</p>
                                        <h2>Promotion</h2>
                                        <p>Promotion is another effective technique to promote the company in the new international markets (Powers & Loy ka, 2010). To become successful, the Commonwealth Bank’s promotional activity will need to meet the customer preferences of the new market (Jain, Haley, Voola, & Wickham, 2012). As suggested by Hulonan, Katsikeas & Robson (2011), The promotional strategy for the commonwealth bank would be the social media advertisement which promotes the products of the institutions across India where people can get proper information through social media. Word-of-mouth and e-mail marketing as well as television advertisement are also some of the promotional strategies through which the bank can and tehri business across the Indian market.</p>
                                        <h2>Process</h2>
                                        <p>The process is also important were the Commonwealth Bank needs to develop their internal portals and system as well as company’s website to serve the customers in a better way. </p>
                                        <h2>Economic Evaluation</h2>
                                        <p>Table 2 outlines the financial viability of the proposed plan which includes expected revenues, and costs for recommended market entry and marketing mix strategies.</p>
                                        <h2>Goals</h2>
                                        <p>The goal of the Commonwealth Bank is successfully expanding the business in India through developing marketing mix strategic planning. </p>
                                        <h2>SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely</h2>
                                        <p>The strategic planning of 7 P's (Product/Service, Price/Value, Place/Distribution, People, Process, Physical Evidence and Promotion or communication plan) of the Commonwealth Bank can be discussed below:</p>
                                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
