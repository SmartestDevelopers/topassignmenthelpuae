This further influences the corporate firms to enhance the operational efficiency in order to maximise the profitability volume of the companies. It is also the only way to sustain in the business and manage social responsibilities as well in long run. The second stage is legal where the firms need to obey the rules and business ethics for being consistent with the expectations of the government and the law.
